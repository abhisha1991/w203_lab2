    "### Introduce your topic briefly. (5 points)\n",
    "Will need to use ftpolice (How would you rate the police?) and ftjournal (How would you rate journalists?)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are measured on a thermal scale (ordinal) from 0 to 100. The variables capturing the rating are:\n",
    "1. ftpolice_therm for ftpolice\n",
    "2. ftjournal_therm for ftjournal\n",
    "\n",
    "The key assumption we're making here is that these ratings (ftpolice and ftjournal) are being used to measure \"respect levels\" for these professions. This is a reasonable assumption given that there are no other variables to capture this sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its important to call out the ordinal nature of the scale and how a value of 55 for respondent 1 may differ from the same value of 55 for respondent 2. In other words, **the same score for a group (say police) may have different meanings for different respondents.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the score of ftpolice = 90 and ftjournal = 55 for a particular respondent shows that the respondent in question has more respect for police than journalists. In other words, **different scores for the same respondent on the 2 groups have comparable interpretation.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the data captured is in pairs. For each respondent, we have 2 scores and we can compare these scores to form proportions of voters that like the police vs journalists.\n",

    "### Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the relevant variables. (5 points)\n",
    " \n",
    "There are certain variables of interest along which we can slice the number of respondents we consider in the test:\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. honest** <br/>\n",
    "This represents respondents who answered the survey honestly. To get reliable results, **we will only consider respondents who are honest for this question.** It is important that we consider responses where people feel honest when answering questions regarding respect for professionals in police vs journalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. ftpolice_page_timing and ftjournal_page_timing** <br/>\n",
    "This represents the time taken for a respondent to answer the corresponding questions (ftpolice and ftjournal). The reason why this may have been potentially interesting is because if a respondent takes too long to answer the question, then he / she maynot be sure about how they feel about the police / journalists. The 90th percentile for each variable seems to be within 12 seconds, which seems like a reasonable time to answer the question \"without hestitation\". **We will further explore this variable and discard responses > (say) 30 seconds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. nonserious** <br/>\n",
    "This represents respondents who had degrees of nonserious-ness in the survey. **We will consider respondents who have values for nonserious=[1,2,3] as our entire population.** We want only serious candidates to be considered when answering a question like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we consider further slicing our base data set (q1_data) based on certain attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ftpolice_skp and ftjournal_skp** <br/>\n",
    "This represents the variable where a candidate was asked a question, but decided to skip the question the first time around. This may reveal the hesitant nature of the respondent to answer the question directly. Hence, we will check the percentage of our base data set to determine how many respondents skipped these questions. If this distribution is fairly large, we will consider doing 2 sets of tests (where skp=0 vs considering all skp values).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. nonserious** <br/>\n",

    "1. The measurements of fear and anger are likert variables. These are NOT metric values.\n",

    "5. Note that we are NOT interested in \"how much more\" did anger or fear influence increase in voter turnout. We are interested in \"which feeling dominated the voter turnout increase in 2018\". Specifically, **we are interested in the sign of the test** where the sign indicates which feeling is dominant. Note that because we use non-parametric signed tests, we are throwing out information of the likert scale (how much feeling).\n",
