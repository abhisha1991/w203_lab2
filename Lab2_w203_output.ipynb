    "## Question 1: Do US voters have more respect for the police or for journalists?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduce your topic briefly. (5 points)\n",
    "Will need to use ftpolice (How would you rate the police?) and ftjournal (How would you rate journalists?)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are measured on a thermal scale (ordinal) from 0 to 100. The variables capturing the rating are:\n",
    "1. ftpolice_therm for ftpolice\n",
    "2. ftjournal_therm for ftjournal\n",
    "\n",
    "The key assumption we're making here is that these ratings (ftpolice and ftjournal) are being used to measure \"respect levels\" for these professions. This is a reasonable assumption given that there are no other variables to capture this sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its important to call out the ordinal nature of the scale and how a value of 55 for respondent 1 may differ from the same value of 55 for respondent 2. In other words, **the same score for a group (say police) may have different meanings for different respondents.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the score of ftpolice = 90 and ftjournal = 55 for a particular respondent shows that the respondent in question has more respect for police than journalists. In other words, **different scores for the same respondent on the 2 groups have comparable interpretation.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the data captured is in pairs. For each respondent, we have 2 scores and we can compare these scores to form proportions of voters that like the police vs journalists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the relevant variables. (5 points)\n",
    " \n",
    "There are certain variables of interest along which we can slice the number of respondents we consider in the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we create a base data set (called q1_data):\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. honest** <br/>\n",
    "This represents respondents who answered the survey honestly. To get reliable results, **we will only consider respondents who are honest for this question.** It is important that we consider responses where people feel honest when answering questions regarding respect for professionals in police vs journalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. ftpolice_page_timing and ftjournal_page_timing** <br/>\n",
    "This represents the time taken for a respondent to answer the corresponding questions (ftpolice and ftjournal). The reason why this may have been potentially interesting is because if a respondent takes too long to answer the question, then he / she maynot be sure about how they feel about the police / journalists. The 90th percentile for each variable seems to be within 12 seconds, which seems like a reasonable time to answer the question \"without hestitation\". **We will further explore this variable and discard responses > (say) 30 seconds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. nonserious** <br/>\n",
    "This represents respondents who had degrees of nonserious-ness in the survey. **We will consider respondents who have values for nonserious=[1,2,3] as our entire population.** We want only serious candidates to be considered when answering a question like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we consider further slicing our base data set (q1_data) based on certain attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. ftpolice_skp and ftjournal_skp** <br/>\n",
    "This represents the variable where a candidate was asked a question, but decided to skip the question the first time around. This may reveal the hesitant nature of the respondent to answer the question directly. Hence, we will check the percentage of our base data set to determine how many respondents skipped these questions. If this distribution is fairly large, we will consider doing 2 sets of tests (where skp=0 vs considering all skp values).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. nonserious** <br/>\n",
    "We will check what percentage of the base data set population is very serious (ie, nonserious=1) and will make a decision to further conduct a separate test with only a very serious population (or not).\n"

    "1. The measurements are likert variables, we cannot say that the difference between 5 and 6 is the same between 89 and 90. These are NOT metric values.\n",
    "2. Having said that, a score of 89 is more favorable than a score of 5 **(ordinal behavior)**.\n",
    "3. However, these are **comparable in measurement across groups** because they are measured on the SAME scale and measured against the SAME audience.\n",
    "4. The distribution of both ftpolice and ftjournal cannot be determined due to likert nature. **So we will have to use \"non parametric tests\"**.\n",
    "5. Note that we are NOT interested in \"how much more\" do US voters respect police vs journalists. We are interested in \"which group is respected more\". Specifically, **we are interested in the sign of the test** where the sign indicates which side US voters respect more. Note that because we use non-parametric signed tests, we are throwing out information of the likert scale.\n",
    "6. These are **paired measurements against the same individual across 2 groups** - journalists and policemen.\n",
    "7. Notice sample size is large, n > 40.\n",
    "8. Hence, we will conduct a paired non parametric test, specifically, the **Signed test for Dependent Samples**\n",
    "9. We **could have performed a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for paired data**, but that will answer the question - \"How much more / less are the police respected compared to journalists by US Voters?\". That answers a different question from the one being asked, although it would have more statistical power than the signed test. \n",
